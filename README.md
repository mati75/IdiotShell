### IDIOT SHELL
Compile and set the binary as shell in 

`/etc/shells`

for any (l)user that makes your life miserable, disturbes your lazy evening or is simply too stupid to be given a real shell account.

Feel free to use and modify it to suit your needs best!

Put 'roll.sh' in /usr/local/bin/roll.sh
